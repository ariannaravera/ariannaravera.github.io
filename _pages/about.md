About me
======
Passionate about programming and driven by a deep fascination for the realms of medicine and biology, I have dedicated myself to merging these two interests. My focus lies in leveraging AI algorithms and techniques to analyze biomedical images.

With an academic background spanning Italy and Sweden, I had the privilege of collaborating with the Uppsala hospital for some months on an impactful thesis project. To further enhance my skill set, I gained valuable experience through a year-long tenure at a prominent consulting company in Italy before transitioning back to the academic environment.

Currently, I am thriving in my role at the Computing and Research Support Division of the University of Lausanne. Here, I engage in daily collaborations with esteemed researchers and contribute to cutting-edge projects within the Faculty of Biology and Medicine (FBM). The continuous learning opportunities and meaningful work I encounter every day bring me immense satisfaction.
